# PasswordProtector-Plus

This is a useful utility program to store and delete passwords for all your needs, and access them all with just one password. 

## Browser extension (TODO)
The browser extension can be used to automatically query the passwords from this program to the browser, circumventing the actual typing of the password. By simply placing the actual program on a USB stick or on a seperate device, the attacker would require both the master password you put into the program, and the password database you placed on the sepearte device/ USB. The browser extension would then query the passwords of the current website through a secure network connection. In order to maximize security, you would just have to enter the verification ID that is shown on the program, which changes every 30 seconds.
